# 598. Range Addition II
Given an m * n matrix M initialized with all 0's and several update operations.

Operations are represented by a 2D array, and each operation is represented by an array with two positive integers a and b, which means M[i][j] should be added by one for all 0 <= i < a and 0 <= j < b.

You need to count and return the number of maximum integers in the matrix after performing all the operations.
```
Example 1:

Input: 
m = 3, n = 3
operations = [[2,2],[3,3]]
Output: 4
Explanation: 
Initially, M = 
[[0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0]]

After performing [2,2], M = 
[[1, 1, 0],
 [1, 1, 0],
 [0, 0, 0]]

After performing [3,3], M = 
[[2, 2, 1],
 [2, 2, 1],
 [1, 1, 1]]

So the maximum integer in M is 2, and there are four of it in M. So return 4.

Note:

    The range of m and n is [1,40000].
    The range of a is [1,m], and the range of b is [1,n].
    The range of operations size won't exceed 10,000.

From this figure, we can observe that the maximum elements will be the ones which lie in the intersection region of the rectangles representing the operations. Further, we can observe that to count the number of elements lying in this intersection region, we don't actually need to perform the operations, but we need to determine the lower right cornerof the intersecting region only. This corner is given by (x,y)=(min(op[0],min(op[1]))\big(x, y\big) = \big(\text{min}(op[0], \text{min}(op[1])\big)(x,y)=(min(op[0],min(op[1])), where min(op[i])\text{min}(op[i])min(op[i]) reprsents the minimum value of op[i]op[i]op[i] from among all the op[i]op[i]op[i]'s in the given set of operations.

Thus, the resultant count of elements lying in the intersection is given by: xxxxyyy.
```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int maxCount(int m, int n, vector<vector<int>>& ops) {
        for (int i = 0; i < ops.size(); ++i) {
            m = min(m, ops[i][0]);
            n = min(n, ops[i][1]);
        }
        return m*n;        
    }
};
